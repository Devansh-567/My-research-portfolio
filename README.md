_Abstract_: - DMS 4096 introduces an advanced encryption approach designed to meet the growing demand for high- performance and secure data storage solutions. Conventional encryption algorithms like AES-256 and RSA-4096 face challenges, particularly in handling performance bottlenecks, key management inefficiencies, and vulnerabilities to side- channel attacks. The DMS 4096 algorithm, with its innovative architecture, enhances both security strength and execution efficiency in encrypted systems. By employing a novel key management strategy and an optimized encryption mechanism, DMS 4096 is designed to surpass AES-256 and RSA-4096 in encryption speed and data privacy. This paper presents a comparative analysis of DMS 4096 against traditional algorithms based on key performance indicators such as execution time, security robustness, and entropy values. Initial findings suggest that DMS 4096 not only accelerates encryption processes but also strengthens data integrity while maintaining robust security measures. Its promising applications in IoT, cloud computing, and post-quantum cryptography, DMS 4096 has the potential to enhance data confidentiality and optimize system performance in real-world implementations.

_Abstract_: Modern warfare brings the challenges that demand new and innovative technologies to achieve success while keeping risks to a minimum. In this paper, we discuss the development and implementation of an advanced drone system designed for highly precise military operations. The system includes a larger "parent" drone that carries and deploys smaller, explosive-equipped mini drones capable of targeting specific areas with accuracy. By focusing on safety and precision, this system reduces human involvement in dangerous missions while improving efficiency and flexibility. This work aims to contribute to advancing global defence strategies with practical, effective solutions for modern and serious combat scenarios.
