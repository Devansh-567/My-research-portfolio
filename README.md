**📝 Abstract**:  
DMS 4096 introduces an advanced encryption approach designed to meet the growing demand for high-performance and secure data storage solutions. Conventional algorithms like AES-256 and RSA-4096 face challenges, particularly in handling performance bottlenecks, key management inefficiencies, and vulnerabilities to side-channel attacks.
The DMS 4096 algorithm, with its innovative architecture, enhances both security strength and execution efficiency. It surpasses AES-256 and RSA-4096 in encryption speed and data privacy through a novel key management strategy and optimized encryption mechanism. This paper provides a comparative analysis using key performance indicators such as execution time, security robustness, and entropy values.
With promising applications in IoT, cloud computing, and post-quantum cryptography, DMS 4096 enhances data confidentiality and optimizes system performance for real-world use cases.

**📝 Abstract**:  
Modern warfare presents challenges that demand innovative technologies to reduce risk and improve mission success. This paper explores the development and implementation of an advanced drone system for precise military operations.
The system features a larger “parent” drone that deploys smaller mini drones, each equipped with explosive payloads capable of targeting specific areas with high accuracy. This innovation increases safety, reduces human involvement in dangerous missions, and enhances operational efficiency. The system presents a practical solution to evolving defense strategies.
